1. IPCC 2021 Global Warming Potentials assigned to certain materials of interest
2. Volumes are converted to masses (kg)
3. User selects materials from a given list and enters a quantity used (input or waste)
4. Calculate Global Warming Potential based on the set threshold and/or the user's set threshold
5. Adjust the masses using sliders to adjust the Global Warming Potential
